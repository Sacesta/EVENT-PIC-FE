### Problem Fixed:
**Issue**: Users could submit the Producer Registration form without filling required fields, leading to errors during submission.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive client-side validation that checks:
1. All required fields are filled (name, email, password, confirm password)
2. Email format is valid
3. Password meets minimum length requirement (6 characters)
4. Passwords match
5. Terms and conditions are agreed to

### Validation Flow:
1. User fills out the form
2. User clicks "Create Producer Account"
3. Form validates all required fields in sequence
4. If any validation fails, user sees a clear error message
5. If all validations pass, form submits to backend
6. All input values are trimmed of whitespace before submission
