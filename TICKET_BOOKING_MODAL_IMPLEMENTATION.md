# Ticket Booking Modal Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete ticket booking flow with a two-step modal for public event details page.

## Components Created

### 1. **BookTicketModal Component** (`src/components/BookTicketModal.tsx`)

#### **Step 1: Ticket Selection**
- Displays all available ticket types for the event
- Shows ticket details:
  - Ticket name/type
  - Description
  - Price
  - Available quantity
  - Sold out status
- Quantity selector with +/- buttons
- Real-time total calculation
- Booking summary showing:
  - Total tickets selected
  - Total price
- Validation: Must select at least one ticket to proceed
- "Next" button to proceed to Step 2

#### **Step 2: Attendee Registration**
- Registration form with required fields:
  - **Full Name** (text input, required)
  - **Email** (email input with validation, required)
  - **Phone Number** (tel input, required)
  - **Age** (number input, required, min: 1)
  - **Gender** (select dropdown, required)
    - Options: Male, Female, Other, Prefer not to say
- Form validation:
  - All fields required
  - Email format validation
  - Age must be a valid number
  - Real-time error messages
- Booking summary display:

### 2. **Updated PublicEventDetails Page** (`src/pages/PublicEventDetails.tsx`)

#### **Additions:**
- Imported `BookTicketModal` component
- Imported `useToast` hook for notifications
- Added state: `isBookingModalOpen`
- Added `tickets` constant from event data
- Updated `handleBookTicket` to open modal
- Added `handleBookingComplete` callback:
  - Receives selected tickets and attendee info
  - Shows success toast notification
  - Logs booking data
  - Ready for backend API integration

#### **Integration:**
- "Book Ticket" button opens the modal
- Modal receives:
  - Event tickets array
  - Event name
  - Callback for completion
- Success message shows event name
- Modal closes automatically on completion

## User Flow

1. **Browse Events** → User sees event list
2. **Click Event** → Navigate to public event details
3. **Click "Book Ticket"** → Modal opens (Step 1)
4. **Select Tickets** → Choose ticket types and quantities
5. **Click "Next"** → Proceed to Step 2
6. **Fill Registration Form** → Enter attendee details
7. **Click "Complete Booking"** → Submit booking
8. **Success Toast** → Confirmation message shown
9. **Modal Closes** → Return to event details

## Data Structure

### Selected Tickets Format:
```typescript
[
  {
    ticketId: string,
    ticketName: string,
    quantity: number,
    price: number
  }
]
```

### Attendee Info Format:
```typescript
{
  fullName: string,
  email: string,
  phone: string,
  age: string,
  gender: 'male' | 'female' | 'other' | 'prefer-not-to-say'
}
```

## Next Steps (Backend Integration)

The `handleBookingComplete` function is ready for backend integration:

```typescript
const handleBookingComplete = (selectedTickets, attendeeInfo) => {
  // TODO: Implement these steps:
  // 1. Send booking data to backend API
  // 2. Process payment (integrate payment gateway)
  // 3. Send confirmation email to attendee
  // 4. Navigate to confirmation/receipt page
  // 5. Update ticket availability in database
};
```
