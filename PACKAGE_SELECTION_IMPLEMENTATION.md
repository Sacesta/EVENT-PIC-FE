## Data Flow

### Create Event Flow:
```
Step 1: Select Services & Suppliers
  ↓
User selects package → Package details stored in selectedPackages state
  ↓
Step 2: Event Details (package data persists)
  ↓
Step 3: Summary & Submit
  ↓
transformEventData() adds package info to services array
  ↓
API Request with complete package details
```

### Edit Event Flow:
```
Open EditEventModal → Load existing event data
  ↓
Suppliers Tab → View existing suppliers with package details
  ↓
Select category from dropdown → Click "Browse Suppliers"
  ↓
View compact supplier cards with packages
  ↓
Select suppliers and packages → Click "Add Selected"
  ↓
Update event with new suppliers and packages
```

## Backend API Format

The frontend now sends data in this exact format:

```json
{
  "name": "Event Name",
  "description": "Event description",
  "startDate": "2025-10-23T04:30:00.000Z",
  "endDate": "2025-10-23T08:30:00.000Z",
  "location": {
    "address": "Address",
    "city": "City"
  },
  "category": "corporate",
  "requiredServices": ["music"],
  "suppliers": [{
    "supplierId": "supplier_id_here",
    "services": [{
      "serviceId": "service_id_here",
      "selectedPackageId": "package_id_from_packages_array",
      "packageDetails": {
        "name": "Premium Package",
        "description": "Full service package",
        "price": 5000,
        "features": ["Feature 1", "Feature 2", "Feature 3"],
        "duration": 8
      },
      "requestedPrice": 5000,
      "notes": "Selected for music service",
      "priority": "medium"
    }]
  }],
  "status": "draft",
  "isPublic": true
}
```
